    "This notebooks lets you harvest large amounts of data for Papers Past (via DigitalNZ) for further analysis. It saves the results as a CSV file that you can open in any spreadsheet program. It currently includes the OCRd text of all the newspaper articles, but I might make this optional in the future — thoughts?\n",

    "You can edit this notebook to harvest other collections in DigitalNZ — see the notes below for pointers. However, this is currently only saving a small subset of the available metadata, so you'd probably want to adjust the fields as well. Add an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/issues) if you need help creating a custom harvester.\n",
